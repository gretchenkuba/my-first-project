<p>The very first ride that you head to once you are in the parks is the Na'vi River Journey ride. This ride does not have a long wait in the morning because everyone goes to Flight of Passage however, if you don't go here early it will build up due to everyone coming here after they ride Flight of Passage.</p>   

<h3>Kilimanjaro Safaris</h3>
